Upstream's setup.py needs to be able to git submodule update uap-core, and then
use that to compile _regexes.py from regexes.yaml.  However, setup.py's
build_regexes step returns with no error if the .git does not exist.

Patches here modify setup.py during build so that the build happens from
the submodule source included source package, and is able to compile
_regexes.py properly.
